50 algorithmic problems (fundamental CS knowledge)
--------------------------------------------------

1-7, 20, 24 data structures
21,22 queues & stacks
19, 23, 28 linked lists
10, 12 sorting
9, 11, 13-16, 18 string
25-27 graphs
30-36 backtracking
17,38-45 dynamic programming

Reminders
----------

Graphs:
DFS: By recursion, evaluate all subpaths first
BFS: Using FIFO-queue, while queue has elements, go to next node and add children to queue

Bin tree deletion of node:
three cases (no children, one child, two children)

Dynamic programming:

Fundamental problems
LIS(longest increasing subsequence) problem 39 or 45 (variation)
LCS(longest common subsequence) problem 40 or 41 (variation)

Indexing can be done by 
(index, previous index)
(index, previous result(sum or length))
(x-index,y-index)
(substring-start,substring-end)
(subarray-start,subarray-end)
